# Project Title

Image classification of Dog, Hot Dog, or not i.e. Not Dog. It is a extension of the popular Silicon Valley scene and a fun project requiring some practice of collecting and cleaning my own data, which I gathered by web scraping, performing transfer learning, and releasing the trained model in a fun little python app.

## Getting Started

To run the python app just download all files and create the environment using the yaml file. Activate it and simply run:
```
python main.py
```
You can drag and drop an image into the app and hit Classify! Selecting correct or wrong will update the score board. Note you cannot run the same image more than once (in a row)

### Prerequisites

See the provided yaml file: DogHotDog_env.yml
